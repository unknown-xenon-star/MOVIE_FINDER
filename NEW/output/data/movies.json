The couple get into a bitter fight at the end of which Aman resolves to somehow bring money home but stops Meera from leaving for Uttarakhand. Aman in rage and fury steps out of the house and meets with a fatal accident. The doctor tells Meera that Aman has gone into a coma for an undefined time. Meera is devastated but patiently waits for Aman. Then one day Aman wakes up. Meera who is overjoyed to get Aman back, resolves to bring Aman home and start their lives all over again. But while Meera borrows money to take care of the hospital bills she realizes Aman has hit the bottle within the confines of the hospital. At this point Meera stops chasing hope. She leaves aman to himself and leaves for the ghost writing job in Uttarakhand. Meera reaches Binsar station, a remotely populated town in Uttarakhand. The town is quiet and eerie. Matthew, Siddharth's butler, receives Meera and takes her to Siddharth's palace. While this happens, Aman is visited by a strange blind man in his dream, Purohit. He warns him that his wife's life is in danger. Aman wakes up but soon realizes that this was not just another bad dream, it was a strange prophecy. Meera meets Siddharth Jaiwardhan, a young and handsome loner, who lives in this huge palace all by himself. But Meera doesn't know that she has stepped into the den of the devil himself. Siddharth is a soul sucking demon, who slowly seduces Meera, puts a spell on her and makes her a slave to the demon. When Aman reaches Binsar to bring back Meera he finds her almost unwilling to acknowledge him. This breaks Aman further. Siddharth is a powerful man in Binsar uses his clout and gets aman arrested to be thrown out of the town. But all is not lost in aman's heart yet. He refuses to believe that Meera could actually forget him. He puts his might together for the love which is still alive and throbbing in his heart. He takes a leap of faith and comes back to Binsar to find a way to get to Meera. The blind Purohit and his accomplice Roohi, soon gets hold of Aman and tells him that Siddharth Jaiwardhan is a demon, who feeds on the souls of bastard children. He has been doing it for thousands of years and now Meera is his next prey to devour on. Aman now has his back against the wall as he is battling the devil. The devil, who is an ancient evil king who has been sucking on souls and never died. Will Aman be able to save Meera, will he be able to be a husband that she always wanted. In this war of Love and Evil, will Aman be able to become a knight of Love.",

    "description": "The title of the film, Jameen Kottai, refers to a remote, haunted location where the main events take place. The local villagers fear Jameen Kottai and the guards that protect it. Many believe that a secret treasure is hidden in the palace. One day, Ra Sankaran and his daughter, Mohini, arrive at the palace where she has a vision of a past life. Meanwhile, an elderly lady secretly records the conversation of a group plotting to retrieve the treasure. The lather gives the recording to Manickam, who finds a clue relating to the location of the treasure, which then leads him to Karuvapatti. Manickam and his friend Prakash decide to buy the land in order to start searching for the treasure before others do. They are small-time crooks who want the treasure at any cost. They plow the land and uncover a large object carved with hideous figures. Madasamy is a skilled locksmith who lives with his sister Rajeshwari. He discovers that the village's doctor, Vasanth, is secretly in love with his sister, and he decides to arrange their marriage. The doctor's family asks for a huge dowry for his sister, which Madasamy accepts. He then decides to find work in the city hoping to earn a greater salary. As Madasamy is leaving the village, he meets Prakash and Manickam who ask him for a favor. They offer him money to accompany them to the palace. The three visit the palace that same night, and Madasamy manages to open its main safe. Prakash and Manickam give him enough money to fund his sister's wedding and Madasamy leaves. In the safe, a manuscript explains how to obtain the treasure. A few days later, on the night of the full moon, Prakash and Manickam return to the palace. There, Prakash beats up Manickam with the intention of keeping the treasure for himself. Alone, Prakash conducts the ritual as described in the manuscript. However, to his astonishment, he summons a satanic spirit that ends up killing him. The spirit flees the palace and encounters Rajeshwari, \"possessing\" his body. Meanwhile, Madasamy arranges his sister's wedding and goes to Chennai to consult an astrologer. The astrologer says his sister's marriage will happen successfully, but Ra Sankaran says it will not. Madasamy gets angry and tries to beat him. In the ensuing scuffle, Madasamy is arrested by the police. Rajeshwari faints during the wedding ceremony and the groom's family halt the proceedings. The groom, Vasanth, questions the paternity of the child Rajeshwari is revealed to be carrying. Still possessed by the evil spirit, she kills Vasanth. Madasamy returns home to discover his sister has murdered her lover. He takes his sister to a doctor, but the doctor is a fraud who has been conjured by the devil and declares Rajeshwari not pregnant. Ra Sankaran then discovers that the doctor is an aspect of the evil spirit, eventually killing him. The murder of Ra Sankaran is observed by Madasamy in a reflection on the water that reveals the doctor in his true ghostly form. Ra Sankaran advises him to go to Ammapettai Kali temple to discover the truth. He complies and finds that in his previous life he was a general in Jameen Kottai. The Jameen wanted to be immortal and so on the advice of Mahakanni, an old sorceress, he planned to kill 99 people who were born in Rohini star and Kanni Lagna. Since Madasamy had the same Nakshatra, he was killed. Madasamy planned to marry Mohini. Mahakanni advises Jameen to have sex with Rajeshwari who is a sister to Madasamy and sacrifice the child to Satan. Jameen and his men try to rape Mohini and Rajeshwari, but Mohini, using her power of chastity, burns Jameen and his army. Due to his sacrifices, Jameen's heart is not destroyed and Mahakanni promises Jameen that on the 7th generation, they will be reborn and fulfill his destiny. Madasamy tries to possess Jameen Kottai and destroy the heart, but the spirits make him old and sap him of his youth. The Supreme Goddess Bhadrakali, who is a famous deity in the preceding devotional neighborhood village Ammanoor, then kills the Satanic spirit from the Jameen Kottai and saves everyone in the village. Thus the film concludes with a happy, and devotional ending.",

Harry, the protagonist is surrounded by an unknown aura but the positive energy is saving him from each fall. Shanky, Harry's girlfriend, tries to calm him down each time Harry tries explaining her mysterious happenings he experiences. Accompanying these two are Lucky, Lovely and Vicky. Though even the other friends do not believe Harry and consider these happening a telltale yet when they come across Himmat, the trekking guide with baffling aura, they realize that there are suspicious things surrounding them ever since they started their journey. Another character gets added to the story when the group is trekking the mountainous region of Pithoragarh. Jenny has come to Himalaya from England for research on ghost. But will this group surpass these supernatural powers that are pulling them to their death or will they disappear like most people did in the wild forests of Pithoragarh.",

After ignoring the woman's pleas to see a patient at her house, he receives a blow to the head and collapses. Upon waking up, he finds himself trapped in the house of three women who call each other \"mamoni.\" The house is a swamp of time and space where the same people repeat the same actions and words every day at the same time. When the doctor, who only looks for an opportunity to escape, eventually becomes accustomed to the death-like life, a crack in time begins to appear. Co-directed by Rajdeep Paul and Sarmistha Maiti, House of Time is a suspenseful allegory about the pandemic times, with deepened misunderstanding and hatred among people. It was produced by Aurora Films, which has been producing and distributing Indian films since 1906.",

The couple's wedding plans seem to be back on track until Goga spots the ghostly figure of Kamal's grandmother wandering around. Despite Goga's attempt to prove the sighting, nobody else can see the apparition but him. In desperation, Goga seeks guidance from Notorious Baba who advises him to summon the ghost of his own grandfather to help. Unfortunately, the only person who can see Goma's grandfather's ghost is Kamal. What follows is a side-splitting tale of confusion and errors, but is ultimately a poignant tribute to the enduring power of love.",

To make matters worse, more disappearances occur, with the mysterious appearance of an investigator of the occult, Robert.

Legend has it that Alter and Susan were attacked by bandits at the villa. Alter was brutally beaten, and thrown off a cliff. Susan, unable to bear his death, jumped off the same cliff.

Carol is the first of the six to see one of the ghosts; however, the others don't believe her. Their disbelief dies before they do....",

The problems that he encounters in his mission form the crux. It is a convoluted story that makes you to leave reasoning and logic in cold storage. Narendran (Nassar) as usual, is good at his role. Charumadhi (Swarnamalya) gets an opportunity to show her acting talent. Unfortunately, Rishi (Richard Rishi), who had a good outing in Naalai, recently just plays a second fiddle. Charuhasan has nothing much to do. The movie begins with Professor Narendran, who finds out that rocks from lunar craters would fall on earth and destroy the world soon. Narendran and his assistant Charumadhi choose to keep it as a secret and decide not to create panic in the earth. They are joined by a group of students which include Rishi and Boys Manikandan in accomplishing their mission. They come across a different problem. Charumadhi's father (Charuhasan), led by a group of men, forms a cult. They decide to die and plan to take revenge on the humans for polluting the world. Narendran and his team come to know of their plans. The rest is how they tackle both the problems.",

    "description": "The film tells the chilling story of four inseparable friends who decide to break the monotony of their lives with an adventurous late-night drive. Searching for fun and thrill, they wander far from the main highway, stumbling upon a mysterious, unnamed path that the locals whisper about as 'Bhramh Road.' Initially, the group laughs off the eerie atmosphere, treating the journey as just another part of their adventure. But as the road stretches on endlessly through a dense, unnatural fog, the atmosphere shifts from excitement to pure dread. Suddenly, the laws of physics and logic seem to bend. Their vehicle stalls without reason, and the silence of the night is shattered by inexplicable paranormal activities. Whispers in the wind, shadows that move on their own, and a feeling of being watched by something ancient and malevolent begin to tear at their sanity. The road becomes a psychological labyrinth where every exit leads them back to the same terrifying spot. As the night grows longer and the paranormal encounters become more physical and violent, the friends are forced to face a horrifying question: Is this road a physical place, or a trap designed to consume their souls? Caught between reality and a waking nightmare, the group's bond is tested like never before. With no signal, no help, and an entity that feeds on their fear, their 'fun trip' turns into a desperate battle for survival. Will they be able to solve the mystery of the 'Bhramh' and find their way back to civilization, or will they become just another legend lost on the road that doesn't exist? 'Bhramh Road: The Beginning' is a high-octane psychological horror-comedy that keeps you guessing until the very last second.",

    "description": "The word Bhayam means Fear. The story is all about obsession for someone. It's a love story of Shree and Myra which no longer exists due to clashes between the families. Shree and Myra were the film making students where they along with their others friends had gone to a haunted hills to shoot for their short film for their final project. When they go to the hills for shoot they experienced some supernatural activities.Group members started missing Thus the obsession, thrill, horror and action clearly defines the name of the film. It will be quite interesting to watch the film in the theatre as it has all the elements.",

In its path lies Carona, a sleepy village of Catholics and Hindus, living on small pleasures of the past. The phantom sets its sight on Ravio, a weary bakery-worker mocked for being 'slow in the head'. On his morning round Ravio gets increasingly lost and desperate, and is ultimately consumed by the phantom. Ravio returns to the village that night, albeit in a vengeful form, leading to dire consequences for the village. Six months later the archaeologist who made the discovery, roams around Carona inquiring about the deaths and disappearances that happened here after his discovery. He tracks Ravio's steps from that fateful day and it leads him to a grove where the reincarnated phantom is resting.",

As night falls, they find themselves lost and stranded, the darkness punctuated only by the flickering light of their campfire. To pass the time, they begin sharing chilling horror stories, each tale more terrifying than the last. The final story is told by a mysterious individual who reveals a shocking secret: he is Kaali Singh, a spirit trapped in the forest for 300 years. He claims to have died centuries ago and has been roaming the woods ever since. As the full moon reaches its zenith, a palpable sense of dread settles over the group. The following morning, the peaceful forest is transformed into a scene of horror. The picnickers are found dead, victims of Kaali Singh's supernatural wrath. The news of the massacre spreads like wildfire, capturing the attention of a determined reporter and a group of friends connected to the deceased. Driven by a thirst for truth and a desire to understand the legend of Kaali Singh, they venture into the same foreboding forest, retracing the steps of the ill-fated picnic. As they delve deeper into the woods, they uncover clues and whispers that paint a terrifying picture of Kaali Singh's vengeful spirit. The film culminates with a chilling scene of a new group of unsuspecting visitors entering the forest, suggesting the cycle of horror is destined to repeat itself, leaving the audience with a lingering sense of unease and the chilling realization that some legends are best left undisturbed.",

    "description": "Behrupiyo is a folklore horror rooted in the soil of Gujarat haunted by an ancient curse. Many years ago, something strange happened inside a royal household that changed the fate of an entire village. A ritual was performed. A choice was made. After that night, unexplained incidents surrounded the land and people learned not to question what they could not understand. In the present day, three friends arrive at a heritage property connected to that past, dismissing the legend as superstition. But the curse still breathes. A young girl hears whispers. A warning repeats: \"Don't drink the water.\" It darkens. It carries something unseen. A strange mark appears. A curse does not die with time. It awakens when disturbed.",
